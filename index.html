    <p>The first day was brutal - a lot of new people, new place to go to every single day and so
        on...still I just think it was a smaller change to my everyday routine. Everything else
        is as it was before. I still have to go to school, do homework, and try to survive the chaos
        that is my life. But hey, at least I have a blog now, right? So I can share my thoughts
